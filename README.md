# Weather App Project
I am excited to introduce the weather app I created using React.js! This app provides a seamless and intuitive way for users to search for the current weather conditions of any city around the world. Here are some of the key features of the app:

## Key Features
<b>City Search:</b> Users can search for any city by entering its name. The app then fetches and displays the latest weather data for that city.

<b>Real-time Weather Data:</b> The app provides real-time updates on:

<b>Temperature:</b> Displays the current temperature.

<b>Humidity:</b> Shows the current humidity level.

<b>Wind Speed:</b> Indicates the current wind speed.

<b>Dynamic Weather Icons:</b> Based on the temperature and weather conditions, the app displays different icons to visually represent the weather:

<b>Sunny Icon:</b> Appears when the temperature is high, indicating sunny conditions.

<b>Rain Icon:</b> Appears during monsoon-like conditions to indicate rain.

### How It Works
<b>Search Functionality:</b> Users enter a city name in the search bar, and the app fetches the weather data using an API.

<b>Weather Conditions Display:</b> The app displays the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the searched city.

<b>Weather Icons:</b> The app dynamically changes the weather icon based on the temperature and weather conditions:

<b>Sunny:</b> Displayed when the temperature is high.

<b>Rain:</b> Displayed during monsoon conditions.

### Technical Details
<b>React.js:</b> The entire app is built using React.js, leveraging its component-based architecture for efficient state management and UI updates.

<b>API Integration:</b> The app uses a weather API to fetch real-time weather data based on the city name entered by the user.

<b>Conditional Rendering:</b> Utilizes React's conditional rendering to display appropriate weather icons based on the current weather conditions.
